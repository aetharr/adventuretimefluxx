# Adventure Time Fluxx - (Unofficial)

Hi all, this project was a labour of love between myself and my wife back in 2013. We made it for a friend for his birthday and even got the cards printed using a business card service, but weren't really sure how to share it with the world... But we recently discovered Tabletop Simulator and figured that'd be a neat place to start.

## What's in the Repo?
* The original source files for the entire project
* High and Low quality Tabletop Simulator images ready to import.

## Disclaimer Stuff
The Fluxx logo is © Copyright Looney Labs, the Adventure Time logo and chracters are © Copyright Cartoon Network. All art assets have been painstakingly drawn by my wife and/or myself.

This is a non-profit project, as I mentioned it was a gift for a friend of ours but we were so proud of it that we wanted to share it with others.

As of writing this, I am aware that Looney Labs have released an official Adventure Time Fluxx, but like to hope that it has not made our little project redundant.
